## General Considerations:

### Flight Regime:

As our Rocket will most likely be powered by a $5kN$ Engine, our Nosecone will operate in the supersonic Regime for the majority of the ascent duration. 

### Content: 

The Nosecone will most likely contain the avionics section so glass-fibre should be chosen for its RF-Permeability. Also a Pitot Tube will be extending from the Tip of the Cone.

### Manufacturability:

Due to the Manufacturing Process described in the Next Chapter it is very difficult and also not desired to produce the entire Nosecone from Fibre reinforced Plastics. Therefore the tip of the Nosecone will be a seperate Part.

## System Description:

![[NosconSystem.png]]
As seen in Figure 1 the Nosecone is comprised of 3 Main Components:
- A Tip Insert (Red) that contains the Pitot Tube and possibly other Sensors.
- The Aerodynamic Cone (Green) that contains the Avionics Section. This Part can be subdivided into:
	- A Cylindrical Section (Right) that is used to interface with the Hollow Connector
	- A "Conical" Section that reduces the Drag of the Diameterchange from $0 \rightarrow D$ 
- The Hollow Connector that interfaces the Nosecone with the Fuselage of the Rocket

## Nosecone Shape:

The Nosecone shape is determined primarily by the desire to reduce drag. Drag is comprised of three main components:
- Skin Drag is caused by the air interacting with the

#HyEnD #SternIV #Struktur 

# System Overview:

The Launch Vehicle for STERN IV is intended to further develop our in-house manufacturing abilities. This approach is reflected in some key design parameters. There are however some noteworthy breaches in design continuity from our previous endeavours.

## Key Features:

### Linerless Tanks: #linerlosetanks

As with the N2ORTH Vehicle we aim to develop Type V composite pressure vessels. We will however alter our approach to facilitate easier manufacturing. Currently our Type V COPVs consist of a ETFE-Liner that is added to the outside of an aluminium mandrill, wich is then wrapped in carbon fibre. The aluminium is then dissolved leaving the ETFE on the inside of the tank. This approach is rather difficult and time consuming. We are therefore in the process of developing an alternative solution. Through the use of different additives we may use a Layer of carbon fibre as the liner, eliminating the need for much of our lengthy procedure. 

### Hull Tanks: #intregaltanks

The external flight loads on the airframe in the tank section are almost negligibly compared to the internal loads of almost $120bar$. To reduce dry mass we intend to use the outer wall of our tanks as loadbearing airframe. This approach brings the challenge to connect this tank section to the rest of the airframe, wich we plan to combat with a skirt laminate. %TODO AUSFORMULIEREN

### CFRP Thrust Structure: #cfktriebwerksanbindung

The N2ORTH Vehicle uses an aluminium piece to transfer the load of the engine into the airframe. The load path is extremely straight , so this part seems ripe to be exchanged with a carbon fibre part. The main challenge is probably the heat emitted by the engine leading to thermal degradation of the carbon fibres performance. To measure thrust we may also attach digital strain-gauges to the outside of the thrust structure.

### Pitot-tipped Nosecone: #pitotnosecone

To obtain a better estimation of the vehicles airspeed a supersonic pitot-tube is integrated into the tip of the nosecone, allowing measurements of tip pressure and therefore indicated airspeed.
